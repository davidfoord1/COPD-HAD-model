# What are the patient characteristics that predict worsening depression/anxiety in COPD patients?Â 

David Foord

#### Background
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disease
that obstructs airflow from the lungs. It is known that COPD patients often
experience mental health issues including anxiety and depression. Hospital
Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score is a common measure used to assess the level
of symptoms. This study aims to identify predictors of HAD score among COPD
patients.

#### Methods

This study used a dataset of 101 COPD patients (aged 44-88, 65 female). Linear regression was used to
assess the relationship between several candidate predictor variables  
and HAD score. 
Variables were excluded where chance couldn't be rejected at significance level 0.05.
Predictors were selected primarily for improving the
adjusted R-squared value with smaller 95% confidence interval ranges. 
Initially variables were rejected for having more than 10% of values as invalid. 
Variables were selected from groups with high collinearity based 

#### Results

The final model identified two significant predictors of HAD score: the COPD
Assessment Test (CAT) score and age. The CAT score, which is a measure of
disease severity, had a coefficient of 0.50 (95% CI 0.35-0.66; p < 0.001),
positively predicting higher HAD scores. Age had a coefficient of -0.17 (95% CI
-0.33, -0.02; p = 0.029), indicating that a negative association with HAD score.
The adjusted R-squared value of the model was 0.3263, suggesting that
approximately 32.63% of the variance in HAD scores is explained by these
predictors.

#### Discussion

The findings suggest that disease severity, as measured by the CAT score, is a
significant predictor of worse mental health outcomes. This highlights a need
for comprehensive health care that addresses by the physical and mental health
impact of COPD. The negative association between age and HAD score may indicate
that older patients have developed better coping mechanisms or have otherwise
benefited from better medical management. Further research is need to explore
these relationships and develop targeted interventions to
improve the psychological well-being of COPD patients.
