# What are the patient characteristics that predict worsening depression/anxiety in COPD patients?Â

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disease
that obstructs airflow from the lungs. It is known that COPD patients often
experience mental health issues including anxiety and depression. Hospital
Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score is a common measure used to assess the level
of symptoms. This study aims to identify predictors of HAD score among COPD
patients.

This study used a dataset of 101 COPD patients (aged 44-88, 36 female). Linear
regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between several
candidate predictor variables and HAD score. Predictors were excluded for
invalid data and where the regression model couldn't reject chance 
at significance level p < 0.05. Predictors were selected primarily for
improving the adjusted R-squared value with smaller 95% confidence interval (CI)
ranges.

The final model identified two significant predictors of HAD score: the COPD
Assessment Test (CAT) score and age. CAT score, a measure of disease severity,
was positively associated with HAD score. For every 1 unit increase in CAT
score, HAD score increased by 0.50 (95% CI 0.35, 0.66; p < 0.001). For every 1
year increase in age, HAD score decreased by 0.17 (95% CI
-0.33, -0.02; p = 0.029). The model explained 32.63% of the variance in HAD scores 
(adjusted R-squared).

The findings highlight that more severe COPD symptoms are associated with worse
mental health outcomes, indicating a need for comprehensive health care that
addresses both the physical and mental health impacts of COPD. The negative
association between age and HAD score may suggest that older patients have
developed better coping mechanisms or have benefited from better medical
management. Further research is needed to explore these relationships and
develop targeted interventions to improve the psychological well-being of COPD
patients.
