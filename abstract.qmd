# What are the patient characteristics that predict worsening depression/anxiety in COPD patients?Â 

David Foord

### Background
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disease
that obstructs airflow from the lungs. It is known that COPD patients often
experience mental health including anxiety and depression. Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score is a common measure used to assess the
level of symptoms. This study aims to identify predictors of HAD score among 
COPD patients.

### Methods

This study used a dataset of 101 COPD patients. Linear regression was used to
assess the relationship between several candidate predictor variables and HAD 
and HAD score.

### Results

The final model identified two significant predictors of the HAD score: the COPD
Assessment Test (CAT) score and age. The regression equation was HAD = 13.93 +
0.50 * CAT - 0.17 * AGE. This indicates that higher CAT scores, reflecting
greater disease severity, were associated with higher HAD scores. Conversely,
older age was associated with lower HAD scores, suggesting better psychological
outcomes. The final model equation was:

$HAD = 13.93 + 0.50 * CAT - 0.17 * AGE$
